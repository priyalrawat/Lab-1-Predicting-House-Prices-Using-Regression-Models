# Lab-1-Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Regression-Models

This paper illustrates the application of machine learning regression models to predict residential property prices, using a dataset from kaggle which includes over 180,000 property listings. Four regression models named Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, and Lasso were modelled and evaluated with using of standard metrics which are MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2. The polynomial model performed best out of the four models. Two hypotheses were tested in this study to evaluate the effect of carpet area and the number of bathrooms on the price of residential properties. The number of bathrooms was a useful predictor while carpet area was not as substantial as it was assumed Feature importance was used to explore interactions within our model. For example Furnishing Transaction had the largest overall effect. The study concluded the traditional regression methodologies provides a weak baseline for predicting housing prices, suggested the need for advanced methods for future research.
